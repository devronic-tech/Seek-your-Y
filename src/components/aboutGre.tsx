              Determined to do an MBA from ISB, Singapore, the M7 or the Ivy League? You don't need
              the GMAT for that. Over the last 18 months, a growing share of applicants have switched to
              the GRE — and for good reason. Here is a clear, side-by-side view of how the GRE compares
              to the GMAT, from test structure and timing to admissions value and flexibility.
